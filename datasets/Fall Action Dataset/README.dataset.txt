# Fall Action Dataset ‚Äì Human Fall Detection

## üéØ Objective

This dataset is designed for developing and evaluating human fall detection systems using computer vision. It contains a wide variety of human positions captured under different angles and environmental conditions, making it suitable for training robust deep learning models.

>  This dataset was merged, cleaned, and re-annotated by **Ilhem Laifi** during her final year project (PFA) at ENIT, focused on **human fall detection using YOLOv5 and deployment on Jetson Nano**.
